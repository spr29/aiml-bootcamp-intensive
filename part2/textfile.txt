Amid controversy over ‘motivated’ arrest in sand mining case, 
Punjab Congress chief Navjot Singh Sidhu calls for ‘honest CM candidate’.
Amid the intense campaign for the Assembly election in Punjab, 
due less than three weeks from now on February 20, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) 
on Friday arrested Bhupinder Singh ‘Honey’, Punjab Chief Minister 
Charanjit Singh Channi’s nephew, in connection with an illegal sand mining case. 
He was later produced before a special court and sent to ED custody till February 8.
Sensing an opportunity to plug his case as CM face, Punjab Congress chief 
Navjot Singh Sidhu said the Congress must choose an ‘honest’ person as 
its Chief Ministerial face for the upcoming polls.
